{"name":"Steamy","body":"steamy\r\n======\r\n\r\nsteamy, export remote MySQL Databases\r\n\r\nWhy\r\n---\r\n\r\nsteamy has several advantages over mysqldump (and many disadvantages).\r\n\r\nThe main goal of steamy is to make it easy to backup remote MySQL databases. steamy makes database backups fast by relying on SequelPro Saved connections, SSH public keys to the MySQL server your trying to backup from and by running gzip on the sql dump before downloading it to your local machine.\r\n\r\nThis means that steamy has several requirements.\r\n\r\n1. You must have a SequelPro saved connection.\r\n2. You must have password-less SSH to the remote server using public keys. \r\n3. You must have mysqldump and gzip installed on the remote server.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nInstall by running\r\n\r\n    $ gem install steamy\r\n\r\nsteamy will look for a YAML file located in ~/.steamy which specifies the SequelPro saved connections directory.\r\n\r\nThe format of the file should look like:\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    :saved_connections: /path/to/db\r\n\r\nThe path supports path expansion so something like `~/Databases` would work too.","tagline":"Remote MySQL Dumps","google":"UA-172060-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
